# Imperial Flagship

I started this project to find the bricks for this amazing set. 
It is based on reading an CSV file with all the pieces, so you can use this project for any other set.
I just did not feel like making a GUI for it, so it is a command line tool with the csv file hardcoded in it. So you have to build it from source.
I would like some pull-requests for it.

## Future planning ##

- Add custom logic to limit to stores of a specific country
- Add logic which also use the shipping to calculate it
- Add logic to limit the number of shops used. It now just give a percentage of availability
